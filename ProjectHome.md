APRS eDirectory is intended to be used like an amateur radio repeater directory. It queries the OpenAPRS on-line database of recent APRS packets, and it creates a table of results and a gpx waypoint file of results.  Queries can be for voice repeaters, IRLP nodes, EchoLink nodes, Winlink 2000 RMS stations, and digipeaters that are close to a location, within a lat/long bounding box, or within a given distance of a route that is defined in a gpx route file.  The first version of the APRS eDirectory will be a command-line program. The second version will offer a graphical user interface.
